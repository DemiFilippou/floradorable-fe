## Floradorable
Welcome to my first React project, Floradorable! Floradorable is a simple web app for keeping track of the needs of your plants. Just tell Floradorable some simple information about your plants and it will calculate how often it should be watered and send you push notifications reminding you when you should water it!


See it in action [HERE](http://floradorable.demifili.com/)!
Notifications set up using [Pushy](https://pushy.me/) - a great and easy tool for sending push notifications!

## Usage
So far only tested in Chrome, though Firefox should work. Not optimized for desktop - it will look ugly, I promise.

## Setup/Requirements
npm 5.6.0
node 9.7
```bash
npm start
```

## Future Work
SO MUCH!
- Ability to upload photos
- Display information about sunlight needs
- Collect and display information about potting needs
- MORE DATA! More types of plants to choose from

Ability to edit and remove plants coming soon...
